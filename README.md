## ðŸ‘€ About Me 
I'm Currently working as QA Analyst with a strong foundation in software testing and a passion for continuous learning. With experience at Tekfriday Processing Private Limited, a fintech company, I've honed my skills in test case design, automation, defect tracking, mobile testing, and API testing.

I'm eager to transition into a development role and leverage my technical expertise in Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, MS SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. I'm particularly interested in full-stack development and backend engineering.

I'm always seeking opportunities to apply my theoretical knowledge to real-world projects and collaborate with talented individuals. Let's connect and explore how we can contribute to innovative software solutions together.
